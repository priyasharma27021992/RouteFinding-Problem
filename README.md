# RouteFinding-Problem
To run the application you need to the following changes:

1. Change the googleAPIKey in src\common\config\constants.js which you can generate from Google cloud console.
2. Change the baseUrl in src\common\config\constants.js to the backend api endpoint which generates the route using to and from points.
3. Now run the commands npm install.
4. As I have used scss stylesheets which are normally not compiled by node so you need to add SASS/SCSS the project using the link: https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/how-to-add-sass-or-scss-to-create-react-app-c303dae4b5bc
5. Run the command npm start.
6. Enter the to and from points, they should also autocomplete by itself.
